# React Question & Answers Homework Assignment

Using React, create a simple, single page application for providing Q&A functionality. 
The minimally viable feature set should include (but is not limited to):

1. View a list of questions
2. Ask a question
3. Select a question to view additional details
4. Submit answers to questions

If the application is restarted or the page is refreshed, questions and answers do not need to persist.

You should assume that the initial prototype of this application will ship to customers, so maintainability is important.

To aid in this homework assignment, we have used a react-webpack generator to provide the initial bootstrap of the project with node 6. To get started, you will need to run `npm install` from the top-level directory to install all of the required packages.

Additional documentation can be found here:

Alternatively, if you are comfortable with a different setup, feel free to abandon this setup and submit your own(there is no penalty for this).

# Submission
If you fork this project, please send a link to your fork as your submission. If you decide to use a different setup, please submit a zipfile and documentation.
